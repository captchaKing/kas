//! Event handling
//!
//! Event handling uses *event* messages, passed from the parent into a widget,
//! with responses passed back to the parent. This model is simpler than that
//! commonly used by GUI frameworks: widgets do not need a pointer to their
//! parent and any result is pushed back up the call stack. The model allows
//! type-safety while allowing user-defined result types.
//!
//! We deliver events only on a "need to know" basis: typically, only one widget
//! will receive an event.
//!
//! ## Event delivery
//!
//! Events can be addressed only to a [`WidgetId`], so the first step (for
//! mouse and touch events) is to use [`crate::Layout::find_id`] to translate a
//! coordinate to a [`WidgetId`].
//!
//! Events then process from root to leaf. [`SendEvent::send`] is responsible
//! for forwarding an event to the appropriate child. Once the target widget is
//! reached, `send` (usually) calls [`Manager::handle_generic`] which may apply
//! some transformations to events, then calls [`Handler::handle`] on target
//! widget. Finally, a [`Response`] is emitted.
//!
//! The [`Response`] enum has a few variants; most important is `Msg(msg)`
//! which passes a user-defined payload up to a parent widget. The
//! `Unhandled(event)` and `Focus(rect)` variants may be trapped by any parent
//! for secondary purposes, e.g. to adjust a `ScrollRegion`.
//!
//! ## Mouse and touch events
//!
//! Mouse events and touch events are unified: both have a "press" which starts
//! somewhere, moves, and ends somewhere. The main difference concerns move
//! events, which may occur with any number of mouse buttons pressed.
//!
//! Motion and release events are only delivered when a "press grab" is active.
//! This is achieved by calling [`Manager::request_grab`] and allows receiving
//! both relative and absolute press coordinates.
//! A special "pan" grab allows receiving two-finger scroll/scale/rotate input.
//!
//! Each touch event is considered independent. The mouse cursor and multiple
//! fingers may all interact with different parts of a UI simultaneously. The
//! same is partly true of keyboard input, though some actions force keyboard
//! focus.
//!
//! ### Pop-ups
//!
//! When a pop-up widget is created, this forces keyboard focus to that widget
//! and receives a "weak" grab on press actions, meaning that the widget
//! receives this input first, but if returned via `Response::Unhandled` the
//! input passes immediately to the next target. This allows pop-up menus to
//! get first chance of handling input and to dismiss themselves when input is
//! for other widgets without blocking other widgets from accepting that input.
//! (This "weak grab" behaviour is intentional to align UI response with a
//! user's intuition that any visible non-grey part of the UI is interactive.)
//!
//! ## Drawing
//!
//! Widgets do not usually track input events for the purpose of drawn effects
//! such as mouse-hover. Instead, a widget calls [`WidgetCore::input_state`]
//! with a reference to the [`ManagerState`] (which is passed to
//! [`Layout::draw`] calls) in order to obtain an [`InputState`] instance.
//!
//! [`WidgetId`]: crate::WidgetId
